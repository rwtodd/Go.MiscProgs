# casthex  -- I Ching Hexagrams

This is a program to display *I Ching* castings.  The following options
are available out of the box:

  * -coins  == use the 3-Coins method
  * -static == generate a random hexagram with no moving lines 
  * -stalks == use the yarrow stalks method

You can also manually give a casting as a 6-character string from the 
set '6', '7', '8', and '9' for each line.   

Usage:

    bash-3.2$ ./casthex
